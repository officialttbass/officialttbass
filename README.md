👋 Hi, I’m Timothy.

I am a recent college graduate from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. I'm very eager to grow my professional portfolio as I start on this
next journey of mine.

I'm interested in learning more in either of the fields listed below:
- software development
- data analytics
- user experience engineering

Here's my email. I would love collaborate on any future projects in the areas I'm interested in learning more about!
